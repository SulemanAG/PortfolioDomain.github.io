            <ol>
                <li><strong>Types of Problems in Nature:</strong> Problems in nature include iteration, recursion, and backtracking. Examples are finding shortest paths (iteration), solving puzzles (recursion), and generating permutations (backtracking).</li>
                <li><strong>Importance of Space and Time Efficiency:</strong> Efficiency is critical for scalability. Classifications like constant, linear, logarithmic, and polynomial growth help us understand performance across different scales.</li>
                <li><strong>Design Principles:</strong> Key principles include divide-and-conquer, greedy strategies, dynamic programming, and backtracking. Understanding when to apply each is essential for designing effective solutions.</li>
                <li><strong>Trees and Graphs:</strong> Tree data structures (e.g., binary search trees, AVL trees) optimize hierarchical data storage. Graphs are used for relationships, such as social networks and routing problems.</li>
                <li><strong>Sorting and Searching Algorithms:</strong> Sorting algorithms like merge sort and quicksort are essential for ordering data efficiently. Searching algorithms, including binary search, improve data retrieval times.</li>
                <li><strong>Graph Algorithms:</strong> Graph algorithms like Dijkstra’s and Prim’s solve shortest path and spanning tree problems. They are crucial in network optimization and resource allocation.</li>
                <li><strong>Algorithm Design Techniques:</strong> Techniques like dynamic programming and divide-and-conquer provide systematic ways to solve complex problems by breaking them into smaller sub-problems.</li>

            <h2>Reflective Questions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>How do you determine the most efficient approach when solving a complex problem?</strong> By analyzing the constraints and requirements, understanding available algorithmic techniques, and selecting the one with the best time and space complexity while considering scalability.</li>
                <li><strong>Reflect on a situation where you need to balance multiple conflicting constraints in a design. What approach did you take?</strong> I prioritized the constraints based on criticality and implemented a compromise solution that addressed the most significant constraints without drastically affecting the others.</li>
                <li><strong>What criteria do you use to evaluate the effectiveness of a solution?</strong> The criteria include runtime efficiency, memory usage, adaptability to edge cases, and real-world feasibility.</li>
                <li><strong>How can you adapt an existing solution to address a new or unforeseen challenge?</strong> By generalizing the solution and incorporating modular updates that address the new requirements while retaining the core functionality.</li>
                <li><strong>What strategies do you use to identify patterns or structures in complex datasets or problems?</strong> Visualizing the data, using statistical analysis, and leveraging domain knowledge to uncover underlying patterns and relationships.</li>
                <li><strong>How do you decide when to prioritize simplicity over optimization in a solution?</strong> For smaller-scale problems or when rapid development is required, simplicity is prioritized. Optimization is chosen for performance-critical or large-scale problems.</li>
                <li><strong>Reflect on how breaking down a problem into smaller components can help you approach it more effectively.</strong> Decomposing a problem into manageable parts makes it easier to tackle complexity and allows testing and debugging smaller segments independently.</li>
                <li><strong>Reflect on the trade-offs while choosing between different approaches to solve a problem.</strong> Trade-offs involve time complexity, space usage, implementation effort, and scalability. Choosing depends on which factor is more critical for the problem at hand.</li>
                <li><strong>How do you identify and address potential limitations or weaknesses in a proposed solution?</strong> By testing against edge cases, analyzing performance under extreme conditions, and seeking feedback for iterative improvement.</li>
                <li><strong>Reflect on how applying knowledge from one context can help you solve a problem in a different context.</strong> Knowledge transfer allows leveraging proven strategies in new domains, leading to innovative solutions and cross-disciplinary advancements.</li>
                <li><strong>How do you decide when to innovate versus relying on tried-and-tested solutions?</strong> When the existing solutions do not meet the problem constraints or new requirements emerge, innovation is preferred; otherwise, reliable methods are chosen for consistency and efficiency.</li>
