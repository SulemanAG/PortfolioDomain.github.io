    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>
        Data-driven urban planning system for smart cities with minimal vehicle usage. It will use efficient data structures
        and algorithms to optimize transportation, resource management, and governance while promoting environmental
        sustainability and enhancing tourism opportunities. The system will focus on leveraging real-time data and predictive
        analytics to ensure efficient, eco-friendly city operations.
    </p>

<section id="use-cases">
    <h2>Use Cases</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Smart City Traffic Optimization:</strong> Efficiently manage traffic flow and reduce congestion by analyzing real-time data from various sensors, cameras, and traffic lights. Use machine learning algorithms and real-time data analytics to optimize signal timings, reroute traffic, and reduce overall vehicle usage in congested areas, thus promoting public transportation and shared mobility.</li>
        <li><strong>Public Transportation Efficiency:</strong> Improve public transportation routes and schedules based on user demand, traffic conditions, and other factors. Predictive algorithms can be applied to assess travel patterns and adjust schedules dynamically.</li>
        <li><strong>Smart Parking Systems:</strong> Reduce the need for private vehicle usage by offering easy access to available parking spots and promoting shared mobility services. Utilize real-time data to provide users with information about parking availability.</li>
        <li><strong>Sustainable Resource Management:</strong> Optimize the management of resources (water, electricity, etc.) by monitoring usage patterns and adjusting based on demand.</li>
        <li><strong>Environmental Impact Reduction:</strong> Minimize the environmental footprint of transportation and city operations by encouraging the use of electric vehicles (EVs), cycling, and walking.</li>
        <li><strong>Tourism Management and Promotion:</strong> Enhance tourism opportunities by providing efficient routes and minimizing traffic in key tourist areas.</li>
        <li><strong>Smart Governance for Efficient City Operations:</strong> Improve the effectiveness of city governance by providing real-time insights into various urban metrics such as traffic flow, pollution levels, and public transport usage.</li>
        <li><strong>Energy Efficiency and Sustainability:</strong> Reduce energy consumption through smart management of city infrastructure.</li>
        <li><strong>Health and Safety Management:</strong> Ensure public health and safety by reducing environmental impact of transportation and improving emergency response times.</li>
    </ul>
